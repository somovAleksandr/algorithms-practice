# Below Average

A Python function that returns integers from input arguments that are **less than the average** of:

- **Sum of all integers** in `*args`
- Divided by **total number of arguments** (including non-integers)

This creates a unique behavior useful for specific logic puzzles or data filtering.

## ðŸ“¦ Usage

```python
from main import below_average

result = below_average(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(result)  # Output: [1, 2]
```
